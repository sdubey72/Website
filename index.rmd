##Working with dplyr using Lahman Database
####when using dplyr, we can filter the columns and rows by suning selecte and a filter. lets look at an example using Lahman db. 

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(dplyr)

```

### Usage of "filters" :  Its equvalent to From clause in SQL statments
lets see the homerun for 1972 NYY. 
```{r, echo=TRUE}
Batting%>% 
  select (playerID, yearID,teamID,HR)%>%
  filter(teamID=='NYA' & yearID=='1972')
```

####All the players in Yankee's with Homerun greater than or equAL to 40
```{r}
Batting%>% 
  select (playerID, yearID,teamID,HR)%>%
  filter(HR>=40 & teamID=='NYA')
```


####All the players whoes Homerun is more than 40 and Strike out rate is more than 60
```{r}
Batting%>%
  select(playerID,teamID,yearID,HR,SO)%>%
  filter(HR>40 & SO<60)
```


####All the players of Team PHI having Homerun more than 30 in 1970's
```{r}
Batting%>%
  select(playerID,teamID,yearID,HR)%>%
  filter(HR>30 & teamID=='PHI' & yearID>=1970 & yearID<=1979)
```

### Usage of "arrange" and Summarize : 
### Arrange is equvalent of Group-by clause in SQL, by default it displays data in ascending order
### Summarize is order by clause of SQL statments

####All the instances of players  hitting more than 50 homeruns and having the players with most homeruns at the top.
```{r}
Batting%>%
  select(playerID,yearID,teamID,HR)%>%
  filter(HR>50)%>%
  arrange(desc(HR))
```

####All the instances of players striking outs letss than 10 times having at least 400 at-bats. Players with the smallest number of strikeouts at the top
```{r}
Batting%>%
  select(playerID,yearID,teamID,HR,SO,AB)%>%
  filter(SO<10 & AB>400)%>%
  arrange(SO)
```

####Find the career HR total for all the playersbut limit the list to those who have career total of 600 or more. Put the highest total at the top

```{r}
Batting%>%
  group_by(playerID)%>%
  summarize(Career_HR=sum(HR))%>%
  filter(Career_HR>600)%>%
  arrange(desc(Career_HR))
```

####Find the career HR total for all the playersbut limit the list to those who have career total of 600 or more. Put the highest total at the top
```{r}
Batting%>%
  group_by(playerID)%>%
  summarize(Career_HR=sum(HR))%>%
  filter(Career_HR>600)%>%
  arrange(desc(Career_HR))
```

####What players have the highest average per season HR total
```{r}
Batting%>%
  group_by(playerID,yearID)%>%
  summarize(AvgHR=mean(HR))%>%
  arrange(desc(AvgHR,yearID))%>%
  filter(AvgHR>30)
```

####what players since 1970 have hit more tha 50 homeruns at least once
```{r}
Batting%>%
  filter(HR>50 & yearID>=1970)%>%
  distinct(playerID)%>%
  arrange((playerID))
```
